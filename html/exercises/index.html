    <p>This website was designed with the knowledge ive gained throughout the past 2 months.
      which consisted of study and lots of help from fellow class mates. I hope that one day I will be able
      to do alot more then just develop websites. But in the mean time creating this one was alot of fun and quite
      a large stepping stone into the world of web development.
